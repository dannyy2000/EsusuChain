# EsusuChain Hackathon Demo Guide

## Quick Demo Setup (15 minutes)

This guide gets your EsusuChain demo running on Flow testnet with **automated scheduler** for the hackathon.

## Prerequisites

âœ… Flow CLI installed
âœ… Testnet account created
âœ… ~100 FLOW tokens in testnet account (get from [testnet faucet](https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/))

## Step-by-Step Demo

### 1. Deploy Contracts (2 mins)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd esusu_chain

# Deploy to testnet
flow project deploy --network testnet

# Expected output:
# âœ… EsusuChain deployed to: 0x...
# âœ… EsusuChainTransactionHandler deployed to: 0x...
```

Save your contract address - you'll need it!

### 2. Setup Your Account (1 min)

```bash
# Setup circle manager
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/setup_circle_manager.cdc \
  --network testnet \
  --signer your-account

# Setup scheduler manager (one-time)
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/setup_scheduler_manager.cdc \
  --network testnet \
  --signer your-account
```

### 3. Create Demo Circle (1 min)

**For hackathon demo, use SHORT cycle duration (60 seconds = 1 minute)**

```bash
# Create 3-member circle with 1-minute cycles
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/create_circle.cdc \
  3 5.0 60.0 \
  --network testnet \
  --signer your-account
```

Parameters:
- `3` = 3 members
- `5.0` = 5 FLOW contribution per member
- `60.0` = 60 seconds (1 minute) cycle duration

### 4. Join Circle as All 3 Members (3 mins)

**Option A: Use same account 3 times (easiest for demo)**

```bash
# Join as member 1
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/join_circle_with_approval.cdc 0 \
  --network testnet --signer your-account

# Join as member 2
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/join_circle_with_approval.cdc 0 \
  --network testnet --signer your-account

# Join as member 3 (circle starts!)
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/join_circle_with_approval.cdc 0 \
  --network testnet --signer your-account
```

**Option B: Use 3 different testnet accounts (more realistic)**

Create 3 accounts, fund each with FLOW, then each joins.

### 5. Schedule Automated Pulls (1 min)

**THIS IS THE MAGIC - Set it and forget it!**

```bash
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/schedule_circle_pulls.cdc \
  0 1 1000 \
  --network testnet \
  --signer your-account
```

Parameters:
- `0` = circleId (the circle we just created)
- `1` = Medium priority
- `1000` = Gas limit

Expected output:
```
âœ… Transaction executed successfully

Logs:
  "Scheduled contribution pulls for circle 0"
  "First pull scheduled at: [timestamp]"
  "Cycle duration: 60.0 seconds"
```

### 6. Watch the Automation! (3 minutes)

**Now sit back and watch the blockchain work!**

```bash
# Check circle status
flow scripts execute cadence/scripts/get_circle_info.cdc 0 --network testnet

# In another terminal, watch events in real-time
flow events get A.YOUR_ADDRESS.EsusuChain.ContributionPulled \
  --network testnet \
  --start latest
```

**Timeline:**
```
Minute 0: Circle created & scheduler configured
Minute 1: ðŸ¤– First automated pull â†’ Member 0 gets payout
Minute 2: ðŸ¤– Second automated pull â†’ Member 1 gets payout
Minute 3: ðŸ¤– Third automated pull â†’ Member 2 gets payout â†’ Circle complete! âœ…
```

## Demo Script for Presentation

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "Today I'm demoing EsusuChain - an automated ROSCA (Rotating Savings and Credit Association) on Flow blockchain.
>
> The key innovation? **Fully automated contributions and payouts using Flow Transaction Scheduler**. No external servers, no cron jobs, no manual triggers. The blockchain itself executes everything!"

### Show Circle Creation (1 minute)

```bash
# Show creating circle
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/create_circle.cdc \
  3 5.0 60.0 --network testnet --signer demo-account

# Explain:
# - 3 members will rotate
# - Each contributes 5 FLOW per cycle
# - Automated pull every 60 seconds
```

> "I've created a 3-member circle. Each member will contribute 5 FLOW per cycle, and payouts happen automatically every 60 seconds."

### Show Members Joining (1 minute)

```bash
# Show joining
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/join_circle_with_approval.cdc 0 \
  --network testnet --signer demo-account
```

> "When members join, they provide a **provider capability** - this allows the smart contract to automatically pull funds from their wallet.
>
> The member approves 15 FLOW total (5 FLOW Ã— 3 cycles) upfront. This ensures they have funds for all cycles."

### Show Scheduler Setup (30 seconds)

```bash
# Show scheduling
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/schedule_circle_pulls.cdc \
  0 1 1000 --network testnet --signer demo-account
```

> "Now here's the magic - I'm registering this circle with Flow Transaction Scheduler.
>
> This creates a **TransactionHandler** that the blockchain will automatically execute every 60 seconds. No external trigger needed!"

### Show Automation in Action (2 minutes)

```bash
# Show real-time events
flow events get A.YOUR_ADDRESS.EsusuChain.ContributionPulled \
  --network testnet --start latest
```

> "Watch this... [wait 60 seconds]
>
> There! The blockchain just automatically:
> 1. Pulled 5 FLOW from each member
> 2. Paid out 15 FLOW to the first member
> 3. Scheduled the next pull
>
> All automatically. No human intervention.
>
> [wait another 60 seconds]
>
> And there's the second cycle! Member 2 just got their payout. The system will continue until all members receive their turn."

### Show Circle Completion (1 minute)

```bash
# Check final status
flow scripts execute cadence/scripts/get_circle_info.cdc 0 --network testnet
```

> "After 3 minutes, the circle is complete! Every member contributed 15 FLOW total and received 15 FLOW back - but they got their payout as a lump sum when it was their turn.
>
> This is the power of ROSCAs - it's not a loan, not an investment, but a communal savings mechanism. Combined with Flow Transaction Scheduler, it's **completely trustless and automated**."

### Closing (30 seconds)

> "What makes this special:
> - âœ… Fully decentralized (no external infrastructure)
> - âœ… Trustless automation (blockchain guarantees execution)
> - âœ… Production ready (using Flow's native scheduler)
> - âœ… Works on testnet and mainnet
>
> This could serve millions in underbanked communities who rely on traditional ROSCAs - but now with blockchain's trust guarantees and automation!"

- **Production Ready** - Works on testnet/mainnet, not just local

## Demo Variations

### Fast Demo (5 minutes total)
- Use 30-second cycles
- Show 2-member circle (2 cycles = 1 minute total)
- Perfect for quick presentations

### Standard Demo (10 minutes)
- Use 60-second cycles (as shown above)
- Show 3-member circle (3 cycles = 3 minutes)
- Good balance of speed and realism

### Realistic Demo (30+ minutes)
- Use 5-minute cycles
- Show 4-member circle
- Demonstrates production-like behavior

## Troubleshooting During Demo

### "Circle not starting"
Check all members joined:
```bash
flow scripts execute cadence/scripts/get_circle_info.cdc 0 --network testnet
# Look for memberCount == numberOfMembers
```

### "Scheduler not executing"
Check circle is Active:
```bash
flow scripts execute cadence/scripts/get_circle_info.cdc 0 --network testnet
# status should be "Active"
```

### "Transaction failed"
Check you have enough FLOW:
```bash
flow accounts get your-account --network testnet
# Need ~50 FLOW for safe demo
```

## Presentation Tips

### Before Demo Day

1. **Pre-deploy contracts** to testnet (don't do during presentation)
2. **Test full flow** at least once
3. **Save all commands** in a script
4. **Have backup account** with FLOW in case of issues
5. **Record video** of working demo as backup

### During Presentation

1. **Start with problem** - explain what ROSCAs are
2. **Show automation** - emphasize no external infrastructure
3. **Highlight innovation** - using Flow Transaction Scheduler for DeFi
4. **Demo in real-time** - show actual blockchain execution
5. **Have fallback** - video recording if live demo fails

### After Demo

1. **Share contract address** on testnet for judges to explore
2. **Provide Flowscan links** to show transaction history
3. **Explain code** if judges have questions
4. **Discuss future plans** - mainnet launch, UI, mobile app

## Resources for Judges

- **Live Contract**: `https://testnet.flowscan.org/contract/A.YOUR_ADDRESS.EsusuChain`
- **GitHub**: Link to your repository
- **Documentation**: `SCHEDULER_INTEGRATION.md` and `ESUSU_README.md`
- **Flowscan Explorer**: Show transaction history

## Success Metrics for Demo

âœ… Contracts deploy successfully
âœ… Circle created and members join
âœ… Scheduler successfully configured
âœ… First automated pull executes on time
âœ… Events show up in explorer
âœ… Circle completes all cycles
âœ… Final balances reconcile correctly

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: What if a member doesn't have funds?**
A: They can't join! The contract checks balance upfront (contributionAmount Ã— numberOfMembers).

**Q: Can someone skip a contribution?**
A: No! The contract has a provider capability and automatically pulls funds.

**Q: What if the blockchain is down?**
A: Flow has 99.99% uptime. Scheduled transactions execute as soon as network is available.

**Q: How much does this cost?**
A: On testnet: free. On mainnet: ~$0.001 per transaction (very cheap!).

**Q: Is this tested?**
A: Yes! See `TEST_SUMMARY.md` for test coverage and `run_integration_tests.sh` for automated tests.

**Q: Can I use this in production?**
A: Yes! It's production-ready for testnet/mainnet deployment.
